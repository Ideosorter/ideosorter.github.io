This test will sort you into one of <span id='ideo_lenght'></span> different ideologies based on your answers to these questions; maybe you'll discover something you didn't know about yourself!</p><h2>I don't understand one of the questions!</h2><p>If there's anything you don't understand, we've tried to make any terminology easily looked up, and if it's still not clear, tell us so we can make some changes to the questions!</p><h2>I don't like my matched ideology!</h2><p>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>",
