<br />

## Ideosorter 3 requirements
 - A browser that supports ECMAScript 2022, (the application requires promises, async/await, Array.prototype.at() and the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) (all latest versions of the common browsers, including Chromium based browsers(Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave, etc...), Firefox and Safari)

<br />

## How to run locally
To run locally you follow the following steps
 - Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Ideosorter/ideosorter.github.io`

 - Install a simple static webserver like [npm serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

 - Open the localhost server in a browser

If you dont open the project via a webserver, and instead open the .html file in a browser using the file:// protocal, you might run into a problem with loading scripts and stylesheets because of CORS.
